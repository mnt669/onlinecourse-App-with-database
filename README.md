**General Notes**

This malverous project was a great chance provided by IBM as a part of the IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate Course, in this lab Django is the magical framework I was meant to explore and use to deliver a new course assessment feature and sharpen my skills to have the ability to design and develop and break down the necessary models, templates, and views.

**ER Diagram**
For your reference, we have prepared the ER diagram design for the new assesement feature.
